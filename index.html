      <p style="line-height: 50px;">A framework is a structure that you can build software on. It serves as a
        foundation, so you’re not starting entirely from scratch. Frameworks are typically associated with a specific
        programming language and are suited to different types of tasks.

        Let’s say you’re building a house. You could pour the foundation and frame the house yourself. It would take a
        lot of time, but you could do it. If all of that were already done for you, though, it would save you quite a
        bit of effort — especially if it was done by expert home builders.

        In software development, a framework serves a similar purpose. It’s designed and tested by other Software
        Developers and Engineers, so you know it’s a solid foundation.

        A house isn’t complete with just the framework, though. Similarly, a framework in software development is a
        starting point, but you add higher-level functionality to it to make it work.

        Below, we’ll take a closer look at frameworks, what they’re used for, the differences between libraries and
        frameworks, and more.
        <b>Web application frameworks</b> <br>
        AngularJS is a front-end JavaScript framework. It’s one of the most popular web frameworks and is backed by an
        enthusiastic community.

        AngularJS was developed and is supported by Google. It includes features like two-way data binding, which
        reduces development time, and dependency injections, making it easier for different pieces of code to interact
        with each other.

        Django is an open-source web development framework supported by the Django Software Foundation. It’s written in
        Python, a popular programming language, and is designed to encourage “rapid development and clean, pragmatic
        design.” It’s fast, secure, and scalable.

        Rails is also an open-source framework. It’s written in the Ruby programming language, which was designed for
        ease of use. Rails is designed to involve less code and less repetition and is supported by a large community.
        It’s been used to develop sites like Airbnb, Twitch, and Hulu.

        Express is a back-end framework for Node.js that allows you to start and configure a server with very little
        overhead. It’s free, open-source, and is written in JavaScript. Express has a reputation for being extremely
        flexible. It’s fairly minimalist, and developers have created middleware packages to address web development
        issues.</p>
